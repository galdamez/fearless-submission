# Solution

## Future updates, changes, or oustanding code

1. Add a state management library like Context API, MobX, or Redux
2. Add Styled Components library to make CSS management easier
3. Apply a UI library like Tailwind in the event the app's UI needs to grow
4. Add Font Awesome library in case we need icons
5. Obtain any necessary branding related the customer's needs
6. Add polyphills for support of Internet Explorer 11 and below

## Assumptions, changes, or details of the implementation

1. The app will need a router once we start adding views
2. With a router, we will need to ensure the server can properly route the requests to the respective views.
3. Assumption: SEO is not a priority at this stage. If it ever is, we would have to consider a server-side rendering solution like Next.js.
4. The user is not using Internet Explorer
